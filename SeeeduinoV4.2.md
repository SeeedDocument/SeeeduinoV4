#Seeeduino V4
-------
##Introduction

![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeeedDocument/SeeeduinoV4/master/images/cover.JPG)

Seeeduino v4 is an Open Source, Arduino-compatible ATmega328 MCU development board. We think Seeeduino v4 is one of the best Arduino derivatives/compatibles available. Seeeduino v4 is feature rich, much more stable, easy-to-use and even good looking.

Seeeduino v4 is based the Arduino UNO bootloader, an ATmega16U2 as a UART-to-USB converter (basically work like an FTDI USB2UART chip). The board comes with an additional set of through-hole pads for all pins. These pads are aligned to 0.1" grid. This makes it easy to solder additional pin-headers to plug into breadboard or create your own attachment/shield with 0.1" dot-matrix general purpose PCBs.


You can program the board via a micro-USB cable. Also, you can power the board via a DC Jack input (7 to 15V DC) is acceptable. There is a switch to choose the system's supply voltage either 3.3V or 5V, which is very useful if you want to set the system to 3.3V to interact with low voltage sensors.

Finally, the three on-board Grove interfaces can make your board connect to Grove modules easily. Want to make something awesome, maybe just a Seeeduino v4.2 and some Groves is enough.

#Hardware Overview

!!!Note
    This part is based on Seeeduino V4.2

The images below show an overview of Seeeduino v4.2 hardware features. The pin-out and alternate functions of various pins of Seeeduino v4.2 are shown in the pin-out diagram. This could be used as a quick reference.

![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeeedDocument/SeeeduinoV4/master/images/hardware.JPG)

- **LED-D13**
An LED is connected to D13 pin of the board. This can be used as an on-board LED indicator for programs/sketches.
- **USB Input**
USB Port is used to connect the board to your PC for programming and for powering up. Micro USB is the ubiquitous version of USB, found in most Android phones, and other devices. You probably have dozens of these cables laying around your house.
- **RX/TX Indicator**
The TX and RX LED indicators are connected to TX and RX of USB-to-UART chip. They work automatically, they let you know when the board is sending or receiving data respectively.
- **System Power Switch**
Slide switch is used to change the logic level and operating voltage of the board to either 5V or 3.3V. Nowadays, many new and great sensors are being developed to work only with 3.3V, with other Arduino boards you would need to place a logic level converter between the board and these sensor(s). With the Seeeduino V4 board all you have to do is slide the switch!
- **DC Input**
The DC power jack allows your Seeeduino board to be powered from a wall adapter so that you can supply more power to your project if needed. For example, when using DC motors or other high power devices. The DC input can be 7V-15V.
- **Reset**
This button is conveniently placed on the side to allow you to reset the Seeeduino board even when a shield is placed on top. This is not the case in other Arduino boards where the button is placed on top making it hard to access.
- **Power Pins & Analog Pins**
Just like the extra Digital header pads, these extra connections are something we have personally come to realize people need in their projects, especially the power connections if you want to power more than one sensor/device without the use of a breadboard.
- **Grove Connectors**
SeeedStudio has a variety of sensors/devices that can make use of this I2C or UART connection. In addition, we sell independent Grove connectors to help you make our own sensor connections. The I2C Grove connector is also connected to analog pin A4 and A5 for SDA and SCL respectively if you would like to use those pins instead. The UART Grove connector is connected to digital pins 0 and 1 for RX and TX respectively.
- **ICSP**
This is the ICSP connection for the ATmega328P, it is located in the standard ICSP/SPI position for Arduino Uno, Due, Mega, and Leonardo compatible hardware (e.g. shields) that may use this connector. The SPI pins in this port: MISO, SCK, and MOSI, are also connected to digital pins 12, 13, and 11 respectively just like those of the Arduino Uno.
- **USB 2 Uart**
Pinout of USB-2-Uart. These pads can be used to interact with other UART devices by putting the on-board ATmega328 in reset mode. This makes Seeeduino V4.2 to be used a USB2UART utility board.
- **Additional 0.1" Grid aligned header Pads**
Sometimes it is very convenient to connect a sensor/device to your board directly instead of going through a breadboard, or perhaps you want to solder the sensor directly to the board once you've completed your project, or maybe you want to monitor the output of the pins while they're been used by other devices. In any cases we have added these extra pads to help you along the way. These pads are aligned in 0.1" grid and can conveniently work with general purpose dot-matrix PCBs.

!!!Warning
    Take gentle care in handling micro USB socket, or you might break the socket off.

##Install the Driver

First of all, you need to:

* **Get a Micro-USB cable**
    * You need a Micro-USB cable first; the data cable of an Android Phone will do fine.
If you can't find one, you can buy one [here](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Micro-USB-Cable-48cm-p-1475.html?cPath=98_100).

* **Connect the board**
    * The Seeeduino V4.2 automatically draw power from either the USB connection to the computer or an external power supply. Connect the Arduino board to your computer using the USB cable. The green power LED (labelled **PWR**) should go on.
